# AI-Driven-testing-subscription-logic-for-launched-traffic
To address the tasks mentioned for **testing subscription logic**, **tailoring API calls for 3rd-party vendors**, and **scaling AWS cloud for launched traffic**, here's a Python solution that breaks down the process into key steps.

1. **Testing Subscription Logic in a Live Environment**:  
   - This will require validating the subscription logic by checking if users are correctly being charged or billed based on their subscription tiers (e.g., free, paid).
   - We can use **Stripe** API for testing subscription logic (as a commonly used payment processor for subscription-based models).
  
2. **Tailoring API Calls for 3rd-Party Vendors**:  
   - Customizing API calls for 3rd-party vendors can be done by dynamically adjusting headers, parameters, or endpoints depending on user preferences or flows.

3. **Scaling AWS Cloud for Launched Traffic**:  
   - **AWS** services like **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** and **Auto Scaling** groups should be used to scale infrastructure dynamically.
   - We'll also use **Boto3** (AWS SDK for Python) for scaling operations like adding instances or adjusting load balancers.

### Required Libraries:

1. `requests` - For making API calls.
2. `stripe` - For subscription management (Stripe payment integration).
3. `boto3` - For managing AWS resources.

```bash
pip install requests stripe boto3
```

### Python Code Example:

```python
import requests
import stripe
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError

# AWS credentials and setup (make sure your AWS credentials are configured)
AWS_REGION = "us-west-2"
AWS_AUTOSCALING_GROUP = "your-autoscaling-group-name"
AWS_ELB_NAME = "your-elb-name"
AWS_LAUNCH_CONFIG = "your-launch-configuration"

# Stripe API key for subscription testing
STRIPE_API_KEY = 'your_stripe_api_key'

# Initialize Stripe
stripe.api_key = STRIPE_API_KEY

# Initialize Boto3 client for Auto Scaling and ELB
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=AWS_REGION)
autoscaling_client = boto3.client('autoscaling', region_name=AWS_REGION)
elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2', region_name=AWS_REGION)

# Function to test subscription logic (for creators and admins)
def test_subscription_logic(user_id, subscription_id):
    try:
        # Retrieve subscription details from Stripe (assuming the subscription is created on Stripe)
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.retrieve(subscription_id)
        user = get_user_from_db(user_id)  # Retrieve user info from your database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)

        # Validate the subscription status (active, cancelled, trial, etc.)
        if subscription.status == 'active':
            print(f"User {user_id} subscription is active")
            # Implement business logic based on active status
        else:
            print(f"User {user_id} has a non-active subscription status: {subscription.status}")
            # Handle accordingly (e.g., restrict access to features)

        # Additional revenue management logic (could involve checking for payment failures, retries, etc.)

            return response.json()
        else:
            print(f"API call to {vendor_name} failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
            return None

# Helper function to simulate retrieving user data from a database
def get_user_from_db(user_id):

    # Example: Test subscription logic
    user_id = "user_123"
    subscription_id = "sub_abc123"
    test_subscription_logic(user_id, subscription_id)

    # Example: Tailor API call for vendor 1
    vendor_name = "vendor_1"
    endpoint = "data/endpoint"
    payload = {"data": "test"}
    vendor_response = call_vendor_api(vendor_name, endpoint, payload)

        print(f"Vendor API response: {vendor_response}")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### **Explanation of Code**:

1. **Testing Subscription Logic**:
   - This function checks the subscription status from Stripe (`stripe.Subscription.retrieve(subscription_id)`) and validates the user's subscription.
   - Based on the subscription status, it can trigger different business logic (e.g., restricting access or sending notifications).

2. **Tailoring API Calls for 3rd Party Vendors**:
   - The function `call_vendor_api()` dynamically constructs the API endpoint URL based on the vendor name and performs a `POST` request with a payload.
   - You can modify this function to include vendor-specific authentication headers, query parameters, or additional logic depending on your third-party API requirements.

3. **Scaling AWS Resources**:
   - **Auto Scaling** is managed using `boto3` by adjusting the desired capacity in the **Auto Scaling Group**.
   - **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** is used to ensure that traffic is distributed properly. The function checks its status and makes adjustments as needed.

### **Next Steps**:

- **Monitoring**: Integrate with a monitoring tool (e.g., **AWS CloudWatch**) to automatically scale based on traffic.
- **Testing**: Use **Stripeâ€™s test environment** for subscription logic and monitor the AWS dashboard to ensure proper scaling.
- **Security**: Implement proper security measures for handling API keys and managing credentials in AWS and Stripe.

This solution can be further enhanced to handle specific edge cases and scale with real-world traffic.
